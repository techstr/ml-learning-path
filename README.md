# Machine Learning Project

This project is designed to provide a structured approach to learning and implementing machine learning algorithms using Python. It is organized into three levels of difficulty: beginner, intermediate, and advanced. Each level contains datasets, Jupyter notebooks for experimentation, and Python scripts for code implementations.

## Project Structure

- **beginner/**: Contains resources for those new to machine learning.
  - **data/**: Datasets for beginner-level tasks.
  - **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks with beginner-level examples.
  - **scripts/**: Python scripts with beginner-level implementations.

- **intermediate/**: Resources for users with some experience in machine learning.
  - **data/**: Datasets for intermediate-level tasks.
  - **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks with intermediate-level examples.
  - **scripts/**: Python scripts with intermediate-level implementations.

- **advanced/**: Resources for experienced users looking to deepen their knowledge.
  - **data/**: Datasets for advanced-level tasks.
  - **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks with advanced-level examples.
  - **scripts/**: Python scripts with advanced-level implementations.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/machine-learning-project.git
   cd machine-learning-project
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required libraries:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage Examples

- To run a beginner-level script, navigate to the `beginner/scripts` directory and execute:
  ```
  python example.py
  ```

- To open a beginner-level notebook, navigate to the `beginner/notebooks` directory and open `example.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook.
